## Alternative: BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)
For enterprise-level branding:
1. Requires DMARC authentication
2. Need a verified SVG logo
3. More complex but shows logo in verified way
4. Gmail and Yahoo support it

## Current Email Configuration:
- Sender Name: "Pixels Digital"
